# Imperator-Modding-Scripts

WIP for scripts that will speed up the development of Imperatrix: Victoria. It can probably for used for other Imperator Rome mods. 

Planned Scripts:
1. Read countries.txt and turn it into a dictionary. The dictionary will be stored in a python file containing Global variables
2. Parse Excel sheets containing character data and turn it into character files that will show up in game
3. Script that will check the very same Excel sheets containing character data.
